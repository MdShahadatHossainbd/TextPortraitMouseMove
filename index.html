     <p>I remember when the headstone finally arrived. I could see it from the street as
        I pulled into the cemetery, a grey rectangle above a patch of red clay.My chest
        tightened as I walked up to his grave, the tiny American flags I had placed around
        it months before waving in the wind.I sat next to the grave and watched Neglect
        ants march into a hole I imagined led straight to my husband. It made me think of
        disappearing, of his lifeless body, of the time that had passed since I buried him,and
        of the effect time has on bodies. I winced.all how proud he was of his oldest son.
         I began reading the words etched in granite, the same ones I struggled to write on
        the headstone paperwork months before. His first name, his middle name, his last,
           a sigh of relief. And then, my relief turned to disappointment. "Persian Gulf", it
            read instead of "Operation Iraqi Freedom". His Purple Heart had not been mentioned,
            either. I was devastated.us all how proud he was of his oldest son.A quiet and kind man
          Neglect, I believe, is what killed my husband, and he was continuing to be neglected
           even after his death.It is true that my husband, one of four children, was proud to
           join the Marine Corps after high school. It gave him purpose - great pride, even -
           to serve his country. But it is also true that, born poor, he was not given many
           options in life. The military had insurance, scholarships, decent pay, a steady home
           - things he was not used to having. The Marine Corps made sense for him.
           His mama worked at Dollar General for as long as he could remember and loved him,
            her firstborn, more than anything in the world. His daddy was a truck driver
             and gone a lot to make ends meet. A quiet and kind man, he liked to remind
             us all how proud he was of his oldest son.I am unsure why I ever felt attached to that headstone. I remember the nerve it took to fill out the proper paperwork to get the headstone in the first place. I was 24, and the first question on the form read: "NAME OF DECEASED TO BE INSCRIBED ON HEADSTONE OR MARKER."

I imagined my husband's name, 22 symbols that formed three words meant to represent him. I imagined his face when I first met him, a 13-year-old boy born and raised in the same small town his daddy was, a gap-toothed smile, a Southpark t-shirt with one of the cartoon's main characters, Cartman, on the front and the words "I'm Not Fat, I'm Big Boned!"

I wrote his name on the line, and it was official. He was dead. I was a widow.

Maybe I had been attached to the headstone before it even arrived. It took months if I remember correctly, and it felt like torture.

Day after day I visited only to find a blank grave. It looked so unloved. I hated myself for not filling out the paperwork sooner.

He had been buried for months before I had gathered enough nerve to even print it out. Then I had to read the questions. Then answer them. Then find a fax machine. Fax it. I could hardly feed myself after planning his funeral and burying him. It was all too much.

So when the paperwork was finally sent, it felt like a major accomplishment, something I could be proud of. I returned home, drew a bath, cried in it until the water went cold.

Maybe it is that his name was so permanently scrawled into stone, and that means something somehow. Doesn't it? His name, a cluster of words that hardly exist in the world any more, exist so permanently on this otherwise meaningless artefact and somehow, somehow, somehow it brings him into existence again, too. Maybe? I know its weight like I know his hands on my cheeks before he would kiss me. I know the coolness of its stone-like I knew the warmth of his skin. The bright grey, the hard edges, his prominent nose, his deep, brown eyes. They are connected somehow.I had to fill out the same damned paperwork I dreaded doing the first time. Print. Read. Answer. Fax. Wait. It was even more excruciating the second time, my sadness and dread now met with rage. Again, it took months for the new headstone to arrive.

I visited him as often as I could, each time hoping to find a new stone with the correct war on it. But then, when it finally arrived, there was no moment of relief, because the new error was immediately obvious: It had been placed at the foot of his grave, the original one still at the head. Now, he looked unloved, I thought.

I thought about the senseless war that led us here, about every doctor that ignored me when I said I thought he might be addicted to the pain medications they had prescribed him, about finally being told about his death almost 24 hours after they found his body.

Distressed or enraged or somewhere in between, I called the only two people I was certain would get it, Tara and Kristin, whose names I have changed for privacy.

I had met them on a retreat for military widows only months after my husband died. I had just turned 25, and they were both years younger.

We all went to New Orleans with a nonprofit called The American Widow Project. It was a "give back retreat" where we helped rebuild a house that had been ravaged by Hurricane Katrina. We put up drywall, we painted, we sanded and scraped, whatever we could with the limited carpentry knowledge we had.

We were very young women who had experienced great loss in a city that had experienced so much more of it. In New Orleans, I learned that helping others and finding a community are powerful when navigating immense sadness. We were there to rebuild a home for a stranger but, in the process, we also built bonds that would help us survive our own grief.

Though the widows in the group were from all over the country, Tara, Kristin, and I lived within an hour of each other so we not only stayed in contact but became very close. We gave ourselves a name - the beach widows - for our proximity to the Gulf Coast.I felt nobody understood me like they did and nobody ever would. We shared something sacred: An understanding of the world that most would not learn until they were aged or, at least, until their brains were fully developed. We had buried our beloveds. We had had to say final goodbyes to our most important people then learn to navigate the majority of our lives without them.

"I need your help," I told the beach widows. When I explained the problem with the dual headstones, they met my sadness and rage with their own and I suddenly felt powerful.

We would be like Valkyrie in the night sent by Odin to protect warriors and guide the worthy slain to Valhalla. If nobody else would protect my husband's honour, if nobody else would fight for his peaceful rest, we would. "When are we gonna do this?" they said.

I arrived at the cemetery early. I wanted to spend some time alone with my husband. We took shots: One for me, then one poured over his grave.
